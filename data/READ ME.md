All data in this folder was produced by the code. While the files `zfish_atac.10hpf.rds` and `zfish_snATAC_seq_pk_mtrx.10hpf.rds` were produced by the code, due to their size, they are not part of this repository. If necessary, they are available upon request.

The following files were used as input:
- `atac_all.metaData.csv` 
- `Cell-type_Peak_Matrix.rds` 
- `SupplT2.csv`
- `SupplT11 summary table of data deposited.xlsx`
- `SupplT13-all developmental stages intergrated cell type marker of scRNA-seq.csv`

They are not included in this repository but are derived from this zebrafish sn-ATAC-seq data set: Lin X, Yang X, Chen C, et al. Single-nucleus chromatin landscapes during zebrafish early embryogenesis. Sci Data. 2023;10(1):464. doi:10.1038/s41597-023-02373-y . The raw data the input files are based on is documented in the "Data Records" section in the web version of the [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02373-y#Sec18). The raw data from this paper was kindly compiled and pre-processed by Lauren Saunders into the input files listed above. The input files themselves are available upon request. 

In addition, these output files are also available upon request:
- `zfish_atac.10hpf.rds`
- `zfish_snATAC_seq_pk_mtrx.10hpf.rds`
and not part of this repository.
